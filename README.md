# 🧠 Digital Design using Verilog

Welcome to my **Digital Design Repository**, a structured and educational collection of Verilog-based designs.  
This repository documents my learning journey from **basic logic gates** to **advanced FSM-based systems**, covering theory, simulation, synthesis, and verification.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m **Kousik Kar**, an **Electronics and Communication Engineering** student at **Jadavpur University**, 2028 and passionate about **Digital Design, FPGA, and VLSI systems and AI-ML**.  
My goal is to build a strong foundation in **RTL design**, **hardware modeling**, and **system-level digital design** — and share my work openly to help others learn Verilog in a structured and practical way.

## 🎯 Repository Purpose

This repository is designed to:
- Serve as a **complete learning archive** for Digital Design - I (Verilog HDL)
- Help beginners understand **how theory maps into hardware**
- Provide **organized examples** for students, hobbyists, and FPGA learners
- Build a reusable base for **simulation and synthesis on FPGA platforms** like Basys 3
